A Dashboard to help intergalactic clubs find the best talents for them

## Introduction

### Context of the project
Imagine you've just been hired as the new manager of one of the 12 prestigious teams in the renowned intergalactic league—whether it's the ultra-wealthy Black Vortex or the small but mighty Red Pulsar from planet Pulsar X.

With the new season starting in just two months, you have time to scout potential recruits. If you're managing Nova FC, you have a hefty budget of over 62 million intergalactic dollars, giving you the flexibility to sign almost any player in the league. You might consider bringing in several promising talents with that amount.

On the other hand, if you're managing Quasars FC, you’ll only have 15 million intergalactic dollars to work with, making the search for top-tier players a bit more challenging.

Luckily, I've developed a powerful dashboard to simplify the scouting process for teams, making it easier than ever to identify the best potential recruits.

### Goal of the project
This project aimed to find the best players to buy for a given team when starting a career as a new manager in the football intergalactic league.

### Sample size 
I created a database of 12 clubs and more than 280 players. Data creation was done by Perplexity's chatbot. 

### Tools 
Data have been stored in BigQuery, then loaded and transformed with SQL & Power BI. 

### Project Status
Project is done.
