An analysis of football players' potential & ratings

# Analyzing football players' characteristics

## Introduction

### Context of the project
This project came to my mind because I used to play football management games, such as Football Manager, and I liked to consult the database to find the best players to buy when starting a new career.

### Goals of the project
This project aims to find the best players to buy for a given team when starting a career in a hypothetical Football Management game in 2019.

### Sample size 
In total, I collected information on approximately 17,000 FIFA football players. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and meticulously scraped from SoFIFA.com by Masood Ahmed & Talha Turab (see Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maso0dahmed/football-players-data/data?status=pending&suggestionBundleId=694&selectedOnly=true).

### Tools 
Data have been stored in BigQuery, then loaded and transformed with SQL & Power BI 

### Project Status
The project is ongoing. There is no possibility yet to select a team and to suggest the best opportunities.

### Summary



## Conclusion
Traditional companies are huge compared to renewables.
Still, renewables are still making a lot and as much as leading companies in other markets like retail and consulting services.
