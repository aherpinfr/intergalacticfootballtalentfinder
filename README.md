A Dashboard to help intergalactic clubs find the best talents for them

## Introduction

### Context of the project
This project came to my mind because I used to play football management games, such as Football Manager, and I liked to consult the database to find the best players to buy when starting a new career.

### Goal of the project
This project aimed to find the best players to buy for a given team when starting a career as a new manager in the football intergalactic league.

### Sample size 
I created a database of 12 clubs and more than 280 players. Data creation was done by Perplexity's chatbot. 

### Tools 
Data have been stored in BigQuery, then loaded and transformed with SQL & Power BI. 

### Project Status
The project is ongoing. There is no possibility yet to select a team and to suggest the best opportunities.

### Summary



## Conclusion
Traditional companies are huge compared to renewables.
Still, renewables are still making a lot and as much as leading companies in other markets like retail and consulting services.
